my c compiler doesnt want to work defaulting to jon data
for C random numbers to be ~decent~ we at least expect the points in a given plane to be around:  605.0600000000001
the plane fit total for C is:  1057
103.43437014510957 percent of the points fall on these ~40 planes
for python random numbers to be ~decent~ we at least expect the following number to be around:  200.0
the plane fit total for python is:  251
